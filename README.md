* Design

    * Colour scheme
        * The two main colours used are white and frakard burgundy, with a darker shade on the hovered desktop links.

    * Typography
        * The main font used throughout the site is Raleway, with sans-serif used as a back up incase an error occurs with the google fonts CDN. Raleway was used for its similarity in appearance to the band logo and general aesthetic compatilibility with the website.

    * Imagery
        * The websites most eye catching feature is the full screen sized background image of the band in live performance, with a dark overlay on it. The band are very much a 'live band' and wanted this to be the main feature of the website, and what people will first see when they visit. The dark overlay and darker colours used throughout correspond to the darker and heavier musical style of the group.
